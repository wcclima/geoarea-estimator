# Geoarea Estimator

## 1 -Objective

This project computes the area of a given region on Earth. The module `geoarea_estimator` uses the boundary of the region and estimates the enclosed area via the Monte Carlo method. It is purely pedagogical in purpose and serves as a simple application of a technique widely employed in statistical modelling.
